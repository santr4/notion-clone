# notion-clone

- I have made this notion clone by referring to an youtube video and docs.
  The properties/functionalites of this notes app:
  ➡️ It has a landing page which will tell you to sign in. The landing page has its footer, navbar, and body.
  ➡️ You have to sign in through a github accont.
  ➡️ Once you sign in then it will forward the user to a main page.
  ➡️ The main page contains a sidebar which has a avatar which have your picture and your full name and there will be an option to sign out. It also contains a button at center of the body below the logo where you can add notes.
  ➡️ the notes added will be shown in the sidebar.

- I first setup the environment for the project by creating an skeleton app in nextjs. Then I created a folder for landing page and also learnt about routes. Then I made the landing page(navbar + body + footer) => navbar - signIn option, notion logo, button for switching between dark and light mode; body - logo,text, and button to join notion; footer - logo, privacy policy, and terms and condition. I seperated the navbar by a border using an effect of scrolling. Then after signIn => mainpage where I made the sidebar and a logo of mine with my full name is displayed in the sidebar and also a signOut option using Avatar. Also in the body it has a logo and a button to add notes in the sidebar.
